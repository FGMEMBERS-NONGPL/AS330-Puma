<!--
<name>         The name of the submodel.
<model>        The path to the visual model.
<trigger>      The property which will act as the trigger. If this tag is not included, the submodels will be released continuously, provided <count> is set to -1.
<speed>        Initial speed, in feet/sec, relative to user aircraft.
<speed-prop>   The property containing the Initial speed, in feet/sec, relative to user aircraft. If this path is found, <speed> will be overwritten.
<repeat>       Set "true" if you want multiple releases of this submodel.
<delay>        Time, in seconds, between repeated releases.
<count>        Number of submodels available for multiple release.
    -1 defines an unlimited number.
<slaved>       If true, the submodel is slaved to the parent model.
<x-offset>     Submodel's initial fore/aft position (in feet), relative to user aircraft.  Fore is positive.
<y-offset>     Submodel's initial left/right position (in feet), relative to user aircraft.  Right is positive.
<z-offset>     Submodel's initial up/down position (in feet), relative to user aircraft.  Up is positive.
<yaw-offset>   Submodel's initial azimuth, in degrees, relative to user aircraft'snose. Right is positive.
<pitch-offset> Submodel's initial elevation, in degrees, relative to user aircraft's pitch. Up is positive.
<life>         Life span in seconds.Default is 900.0.
<buoyancy>     In ft/sec/sec.  Works opposite acceleration of gravity.For example, if set to 32 the submodel will feel no gravity. If greater than 32 the object will rise.Default is 0.
<wind>         Set to true if you want the submodel to react to the wind. Default is "false".
<cd>           The Coeffient of Drag. Varies with submodel shape - 0.295 for a bullet, 0.045 for an airfoil. Enter an appropriate value. Defaults to 0.295.
<random>       When this is true the Cd is varied by +- 5%. Useful for smoke or contrails.
<eda>          Effective drag area (sq ft). Usually the cross-sectional area of the submodel normal to the airflow.
<weight>       The weight of the submodel (lbs). NOT set to 0 on submodel release. You may wish to set this value to 0 by means of key bindings or Nasal script.  Defaults to 0.25.
<contents>     The path to the contents of a submodel. The contents must be in lbs. Intended for use with drop tanks. The property value will be set to 0 on release of the submodel: do not also set to 0 elsewhere e.g. in key bindings. Defaults to 0
